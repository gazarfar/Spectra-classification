There is a Python 3.7 pickle file containing one Python object. The object will contain training
data and labels for generating a chemometric classification model. In addition to the pickle file, there is a labels.txt file which will contain
the mapping of the categorical Y variables to their ‘real world’ names.
Submission:
A Python 3.7 module file challenge.py containing a class that will be
called in the following way, and will predict the class of each spectra
> from challenge import SpecPredict
>
> model = SpecPredict(‘path/to/your/model’)
> model.predict(testing_data)
> # testing_data will be a [sample x feature] numpy array and should
> # return a [sample x class] numpy array.

In addition to the challenge.py module, The followings are included
● The script you used to train the model.
● A model file.
● An explanation of how to set up an environment to run the code(s).
● Describing the plot(s) to try to understand the spectra from the data 
● A walkthrough of your model building process - please briefly describe different parts of the
process such as feature selection, choosing a model architecture, etc.
● An explanation  for speed optimizations and why it might
be important.
● An explanation of how to estimate the model's performance on unseen data.
● An explanation of what performance metric(s) to use to evaluate the quality of
classification of your solution.
● other utility codes
